> PROD [Live] : https://react-strapi-submenus-prod.netlify.app/

#### Strapi Submenus consists of a straightforward user interface where there is a

- **Navbar**, **Hero**, **Sidebar** and **Submenu** components.
  
  - **`Navbar`**  consists of the `Strapi` logo, page links where each page link opens submenu.
   - On screens <992px, the Navbar will have *logo*, **Toggle** to open sidebar.
  - **`Hero`** consists of a header and paragraph.
  - **`Sidebar`** will appear as an alternative to Navbar to show the page menus when the user is on mobile view for a flexible user experience along with a **Close** button.
  - Each **`Submenu`** is a page with a menu of `Sublinks` which is implemented in a way with smooth transiton while switching instead of vertical menus.
  - Routes has not been set for any of the Submenus links but **Netlify** handles them as *Page not Found* and buttons are not given any click functionality.
- Data is handled by **`data.jsx`** and styles are handled by **`index.css`**
- To run the project locally, clone the repo, `npm install` to install the dependencies, and `npm run dev` to start up the development server on default port 5173.
